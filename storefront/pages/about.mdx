# Lissajous.art NFT

**First of its kind Ethereum-native generative geometric art experiment**

## How does it work?

This project creates a geometric Lissajous figure according to the current
Ethereum block and the price per NFT. The NFT is only created when someone mints
it. I.e. sending an actual transaction to the Ethereum network ans pay for it.
Otherwise it is lost forever.

The block number is hashed and the result is used to determine the parameters of
the draw function. This has three important effects:

1. We know in advance which block will produce which figure
2. Due to the randomising nature of the hash-function the figures are scattered
3. It is not easy to know in which block the transaction will be actually
   included

The other parameter is the price one is willing to pay. This determines the
color of the NFT. So you can show off how much you paid for your NFT.

```
keccak256(blockNumber)       pricePerToken
=> 0x10114ad143...           0.1

drawFigure(keccak256(blockNumber), pricePerToken)
```

The sale is limited to a period of time. After the end-block it will not be
possible to mint more Lissajous NFTs.

## How much does it cost?

The price starts at 0.01 ETH per NFT and increases 0.1% with every mint.
Although if you mint multiple NFTs, all will have the price of the lowest.

The UI sets your mint-price 1% above the actual current minimum price per token
to avoid reverted transactions due to other transactions mined between your
submission of the transaction and the actual inclusion. But you will receive the
excess amount according to your price step.

### Price steps

The colors change according to the price in steps:

- From Ξ0.01 to Ξ0.1 in steps of Ξ0.01
- From Ξ0.1 to Ξ1 in steps of Ξ0.1
- From Ξ1 to Ξ10 in steps of Ξ1

And then there is one price for Elon ;).

## How do I know in which block my transaction is included?

In short: You don't. You can try to set higher gas prices to incentivice miners
to include your transaction faster. But if you really want to catch one
particular figure, you should increase the amount.

Example:

The current block is 10 and you see a figure that you desperately want in
block 15. You can now mint 5 NFTs. So you will probably get: 11, 12, 13, 14,
**15**.

## Are these NFTs unique

Every NFT has a unique ID, although it is possible that they look alike. This is
due to the nature of the Lissajous figure where different parameters can lead to
the same figure. Furthermore, it is possible that two people mint a NFT in the
same block. Or that someone minted 2 NFTs in the block before.

That said, you still have the possibility to influence the look of your NFT by
setting the price and therefor the color. Not everybody can afford to mint a 10
ETH NFT ;)

## What can I do with it?

First of all you should have fun playing around at the intersection of art,
geometry, cryptography and finance. But you could also try to build collections.
There are some simple figures that are worth collecting. Or you can collect a
build up of one figure: One of the parameters is how complete the figure is
drawn.

## How do I know that you are not going to rugg-pull me?

The underlying smart-contract is deployed for-ever on the Ethereum blockchain.
It also generates the figure parameters out of the NFT ID. Nobody can take you
this away. The algorithm to generate the Lissajous-Figure is general knowledge.
So you can build it by yourself. But we will also create an open source webpage
that can create the figures out of the parameters exactly how we do it here.

## Why is it not open source?

The smart-contract is open source and you can read it here TODO!. The UI is not
yet open source because we want to protect you and us from copy-cats and
scammers. After the last block, we will open source the whole project for the
world.

## Who is behind this?

This is a project from [Unchained Commerce GmbH](https://unchained.shop/) a
small open source development company in Zurich, Switzerland. We are on a
mission to unchain e-commerce companies world-wide from big centralised
corporations. To do this, we have created our own
[open source headless e-commerce engine](https://github.com/unchainedshop/unchained).

## But transactions on Ethereum are wasting a lot of energy?

Yes, we know. All new technologies have their problems in the beginning.
Ethereum is on the right way with ETH2.0. But we will invest 10% of the earning
into renewable energy projects. If you know any of them, maybe related to
blockchain, let us know in the
[Chat](https://matrix.to/#/!SEGqAkImeHDZDviOHK:matrix.org?via=matrix.org).

## I still have questions
