# Terms and Conditions.

Last Updated: 19 March 2021

## Lissajous NFT

These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement made between the user
(“you”), whether personally or on behalf of an entity and Unchained Commerce
GmbH, domiciled in Zurich, Switzerland (The company”; “we") concerning your
access to and use of the www.lissajous.io website and the smart-contract based
Lissajous application (“app” or “application”) as well as any other media form,
media channel, mobile website or mobile application, smart contracts related,
linked, or otherwise connected thereto (the “website”, site” and the “app”).

## Lissajous

Lissajous is a digital art collectible built on top of the Ethereum network.
This website (hereafter lissajous.io) is only an interface built to help users
interact with the Ethereum smart contract of the Lissajous (hereafter the
Lissajous Smart Contract). The collection consists of unique digital artworks
(the “Lissajous”) that are hashed on the blockchain and are represented by a
non-fungible token (“NFT”) each. The Lissajous smart contract allows
participants to purchase the NFT representing the generative artwork. Unchained
Commerce will provide a user interface to visualize the digital artworks. After
the sale, the ownership of the NFT, and to the connected art, is transferred
from the Ethereum smart contract to the purchaser and concludes the business
transaction between both parties.

## Ownership, Transactions and Security

You are purchasing a unique token with a unique token identifier or Token ID.
When you purchase a figure on Lissajous you own the Non-Fungible Token
(hereafter NFT) on the Ethereum blockchain corresponding to that particular
figure within the Lissajous universe, namely the NFT of the purchased Lissajous
figure. However, you do not own the purchased figure or any rights of, or
associated with it outside the Lissajous universe, namely outside the Lissajous
Smart Contract context. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the
Lissajous Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network: at no point may Lissajous
seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any Lissajous tokens. Users
are entirely responsible for the safety and management of their own private keys
and Ethereum wallets, and for verifying all transactions generated by the
website lissajous.io before approving those transactions. Use of lissajous.io is
at the user’s own risk and Lissajous is not liable for any incorrect or failed
transactions, nor for the gas costs incurred. Furthermore, as the Lissajous
smart contract runs on the Ethereum network, Lissajous has no power to undo,
reverse, or restore any transactions. By using lissajous.io, and any related
tools it may provide, you agree to hold Lissajous harmless for any and all
problems, errors, and failures no matter the cause or source of those errors and
accept sole responsibility for all transactions.

## Tax

All paid prices exclude any possible duties and charges. You will be solely
responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties
and assessments claimed or imposed by your or any governmental authority.

## Prohibited Countries

that you are not a citizen or resident of the United States of America,
Switzerland nor a resident of a geographic area that is subject to UN-, US-, EU-
or Swiss sanctions or embargoes, including: Afghanistan, Albania, Belarus,

Lissajous) reserves the right to restrict the sale of the NFT token through
Lissajous.io in any jurisdiction or to any individuals or entities at its
discretion. Lissajous provides the website and its connected services “as is”
and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we
expressly disclaim all warranties, whether expressed, implied or statutory,
regarding the website. Using applications on the blockchain is associated with a
high degree of technological and/or other risks. Holders and/or purchasers of
the NFT-Tokens and associated content and artwork are subject to the Terms and
Conditions available on this website. The NFT-Tokens are non-fungible tokens
representing ownership of digital content/artwork only. Accordingly, no
information on this website (or any other documents mentioned therein) is or may
be considered to be advice or an invitation to enter into an agreement for any
investment purpose. Further, as NFT-Tokens represent content/artwork, nothing on
this website qualifies, or is intended to be an offering of securities in any
jurisdiction, nor does it constitute an offer or an invitation to purchase
shares, securities or any other financial products. Due to the artistic and
experimental nature of this project, neither this document nor the NFT-Tokens
have been registered with, or approved by any regulator in any jurisdiction. It
remains the purchaser’s sole responsibility to assure that the purchase of the
NFT-Tokens and the associated art is in compliance with laws and regulations in
your jurisdiction. Lissajous undertakes no obligation to publicly update or
revise any information or opinions published on the website. Lissajous reserves
the right to amend the information at any time without prior notice.
